### **Subscription Economy Survey Dataset**  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains the dataset collected for a research study on the **Subscription Economy**, examining consumer preferences, behaviour, and trends in subscription-based services. The dataset was obtained through an online survey designed to analyse various factors influencing consumer adoption, retention, and perception of subscription services across multiple industries.  

## **Research Context**  
The subscription economy has seen rapid growth in recent years, transforming how consumers access products and services. From streaming platforms and cloud storage to software and meal-kit deliveries, subscription-based business models are reshaping traditional ownership patterns. This study aims to understand key consumer preferences and the factors driving the shift towards subscription-based services.
